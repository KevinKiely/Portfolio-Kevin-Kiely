Kevin-Kiely Portfolio

//Overview//

This repository is linked to an interactive webpage containing information about myself, and links to both completed and future projects. The purpose of this portfolio was not only to practice using HTML and CSS to format and design an appealing webpage, but to compile any future work I do that I feel are worthy of display.
